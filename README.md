# CZ4041 : Machine Learning

## Learning Outcome
I have learnt how various machine learning methods or algorithms work as well as their strengths and weaknesses. The coursework involves selecting a given topic/task on Kaggle and then implementing the best possible machine learning model for the selected task. 

## Coursework Project - Leaf Classification

- Implemented 8 different machine learning models to perform leaf classification - ``Naive Bayes Classifier``, ``Support Vector Machine``, ``K-Nearest Neighbours``, ``Logistic Regression``,``Linear Discriminant Analysis``,``Decision Tree``,``Random Forest`` and ``Multilayer Perceptron``
- Analyzed the performance of the above machine learnings algorithms for leaf classification
- MLP produces the best prediction results (i.e. the highest accuracy and the lowest log loss value) 
- Submitted the prediction results to Kaggle
- Placed among top 15% on the public leaderboard according to the final evaluation scores on Kaggle.

**Disclaimer : The python code used to implement the coursework project is no longer maintained. There may be errors or bugs that did not exist at the time of creation.**

Follow the instructions below to run the source code.

## Leaf Classification

Need to install using pip the following libraries:

1) numpy
2) pandas
3) seaborn
4) matplotlib
5) opencv-python
6) scikit-learn

## Running the program

1) Type the command "python main.py" to run the program.
2) Once the program runs, follow the instructions to run a specific Machine Learning Method
3) To replicate the results submitted, select MLP to reproduce the submission file.
